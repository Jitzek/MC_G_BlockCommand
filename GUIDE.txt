# MC_G_BlockCommand
Minecraft plugin to block commands for certain groups
Minecraft version: 1.14
Plugin version: 1.6

Guide:

To add/manage groups and their blocked commands refer to the config.yml file (located in your plugin folder,
please run the plugin first so it can create it's folder)

config.yml (can be copy pasted) # means it's a comment:
it's best to fill in all the attributes of a group (name and color) to prevent any errors from happening.

#G_BlockCommand

enable-plugin: true #set to false to disable plugin, set to true to enable plugin

groups:
  #group 1 is the highest tier (like Owner)
  group 1: #keep it chronological (group 1, group 2, etc.) else the code won't recognize it
    name: Owner #(displayed groupname)
    color: GOLD #(please choose a color from this list: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/ChatColor.html
    members:
    - #name (name of user)
    - #name2

  #Add groups like this:
  group 2:
    name: Admin #nameofgroup (Owner, Admin, Op, etc.)
    color: AQUA #(doesn't have to be all caps), not giving a value to color could create errors (should default to White)
    members:
      - #name
      - #name2

  #example
  group 3:
    name: User
    color: WHITE
    members:
      - #name
      - #name

blocked_commands:
  #group 2 inherits from group 1, group 3 from group 2 and group 1, etc.
  #if you don't want a command to be inherited place a . before the command (like this: ./command) this way groups
  #under that group won't inherit that command
  group 1:
    - #/command1
    - #/command2

  #Add groups like this:
  group 2:
    - /gsetgroup          #recommended
    - /ghelp              #recommended
    - /gblockedcommands   #recommended
    - /gblockcommand      #recommended
    - /gunblockcommand    #recommended
    - /gremovegroup       #recommended
    - /gaddgroup	  #recommended
    - #/commandexample

  group 3:
    - #/commandexample
    - #./commandexample


default-group: User                    #Default group for players who don't have a group, leave empty if you don't want a default group
                                       #Group needs to exist above

broadcast-blockedcommand-public: false #decides whether or not to publicly broadcast a permission error message
                                       #("player tried to execute command but didn't have the permissions to do so")
                                       #setting it to false will only inform the player trying the command

broadcast-groupchange-public:    false #decides whether or not to publicly broadcast a player group change (/gsetgroup)
                                       #setting it to false will only inform the player setting the group and the player getting set the group
