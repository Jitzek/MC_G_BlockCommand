groups:
  #group 1 is the highest tier (like Owner)
  group 1: #keep it chronological (group 1, group 2, etc.) else the code won't recognize it

  #Add groups like this:
  group 2:
    name: Admin #nameofgroup (Owner, Admin, Op, etc.)
    color: AQUA #COLOR (doesn't have to be all caps), not giving a value to color could create errors (should default to White)
    members:

      - #name2

  #example
  group 3:
    name: User
    color: WHITE
    member:

blocked_commands:
  #group 2 inherits from group 1, group 3 from group 2 and group 1, etc.
  #if you don't want a command to be inherited place a . before the command (like this: ./command) this way groups
  #under that group won't inherit that command
  group 1:
    - #/command1
    - #/command2
